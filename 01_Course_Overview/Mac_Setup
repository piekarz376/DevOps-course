# DevOps Course - Tool Installation Instructions (macOS)

In this course, we will use several essential DevOps tools on macOS. Follow these instructions to install the required tools:

## 1. Homebrew Installation (Optional, but Recommended):

Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies the installation of various software packages on macOS. It's highly recommended to install Homebrew first as it will make installing the other tools easier.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

## 2. Install Git:

If you don't have Git installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install git
```

## 3. Install Docker:

Download and install Docker Desktop for Mac from the official website: [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## 4. Install Docker Compose:

Docker Compose is usually included with Docker Desktop for Mac. Ensure you have Docker Compose installed by running:

```shell
docker-compose --version
```

## 5. Install Minikube:

Minikube allows you to run a local Kubernetes cluster. You can install it using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install minikube
```

## 6. Install Ansible:

You can install Ansible using pip, the Python package manager:

```shell
pip install ansible
```

If you don't have pip installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install python
```

## 7. Install Terraform:

You can install Terraform using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install terraform
```

## 8. Install AWS CLI:

You can install the AWS CLI using pip:

```shell
pip install awscli
```

If you don't have pip installed, you can install it using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install python
```

After installing the AWS CLI, configure it by running:

```shell
aws configure
```

Follow the prompts to enter your AWS access key, secret key, default region, and output format.

Once you've completed these steps, you should have all the necessary tools installed on your Mac for your DevOps course. You can verify their installations by running the respective commands (e.g., `docker --version`, `minikube version`, `ansible --version`, `terraform --version`, `aws --version`) in your terminal.
